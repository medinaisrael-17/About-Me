# About Me

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Israel Medina and I am a Full-Stack developer who works well with others and looks forward to any challenge thrown at him. 

My experiences with computer science, such as school and personal studying, and leadership opportunities, on projects and amongst my peers, has helped me prepare for many circumstances in the tech industry and in life. Iâ€™ve found my strengths to be what I enjoy most such as Javascript,  like creating algorithms to efficiently solve problems and CSS where I get to explore my creative side and appeal to the aesthetics of modern web development. I also enjoy working with databases such as MongoDB or Firebase that allow me to work with multiple data tables and relay that information to the users. 

Focused in full stack development with strengths being logic, communicating ideas and challenges effectively to teammates. Looking to bring my creativity and a strong mind to the workplace to create unique and useful apps.

Please explore my GitHub to see some projects I've created and collaborated on.
